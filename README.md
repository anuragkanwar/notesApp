# Description

**NOTAS** gives you a clean interface to add note with title,
note's body and also you can add todo list which can be crossed 
off as well. You can add label to your notes and can color coordinate
your notes.

After adding all these, you can save your note and display it. 
You can also search for any saved note. You can delete any 
saved note (if you think that's of no use anymore).
You can edit any note anytime you want - Change color, change labels and content.

**NOTAS** also allows you to also backup your notes to a server by a simple login, so that 
you can login from other device and use your note. By logging in,
you can also enable the locked feature which requires a safe password
